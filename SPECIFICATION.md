## "I use Arch btw" language specification

### Introduction

"I use Arch btw" is an esoteric programming language based on
[Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

This specification will only enumerate the differences of "I use Arch btw"
compared to Brainfuck.

### Keywords

The 8 Brainfuck command characters have been replaced with 8 lowercase keywords
that must be separated by whitespace:

`i`, `use`, `arch`, `linux`, `btw`, `by`, `the`, `way`.

A 9th keyword, `gentoo`, can be used to print debugging information.

Here is a comparison of "I use Arch btw" keywords with Brainfuck commands:

| I use Arch btw | Brainfuck | Description                                                     |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `i`            | `>`       | Increment data pointer.                                         |
| `use`          | `<`       | Decrement data pointer.                                         |
| `arch`         | `+`       | Increment value at data pointer.                                |
| `linux`        | `-`       | Decrement value at data pointer.                                |
| `btw`          | `.`       | Print value at data pointer as character.                       |
| `by`           | `,`       | Read one char from stdin into value at data pointer.            |
| `the`          | `[`       | Begin loop. (Iterates while value at data pointer is not zero.) |
| `way`          | `]`       | End loop.                                                       |
| `gentoo`       | N/A       | Print debugging information.                                    |

### Comments

While in Brainfuck, all characters that aren't a command are ignored, in
"I use Arch btw," only comments are ignored. Comments are single-line and must
start with a semicolon (`;`).

Multi-line comments are not supported.

### Debugging information

The default format for the debugging information that the `gentoo` keyword
causes to print is the following:

```
\033[1;34mdebug: \033[0mpc=0x%zX dp=0x%zX *dp=0x%X\n
```

Here is an example debug message:

```
debug: pc=0x36 dp=0x0 *dp=0xA
```

The first value represents the previous value of the virtual machine's program
counter: the index, in the byte buffer that contains the generated bytecode, of
the `DEBUG` opcode that matches the `gentoo` keyword in the source code. Here,
that value is `0x36`: 36 in hexadecimal, or 54 in decimal.

The second value represents the address currently stored in the virtual
machine's data pointer: the index of the memory cell or byte that the data
pointer is currently pointing to. Here, that value is `0x0`: 0.

The third value represents the value of the memory cell or byte, to which the
data pointer currently points. Here, that value is `0xA`: A in hexadecimal, or
10 in decimal.
